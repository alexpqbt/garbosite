# Garbosite

## What is this?

My personal website made for Neocities to experiment with brutalist design, recently learned web design tricks, and a dump for my mini web projects.

## Intent

- Experiment with unconventional layouts
- Prioritize expression over polish
- To practice dealing with a product in production


## Accessibility Note

Accessibility was not the primary goal of this project. Some design choices intentionally trade usability for aesthetic exploration.
